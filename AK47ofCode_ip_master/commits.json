Consequently, the greeting message has to be modified to reflect the change. A goodbye message is added to add more depth and friendliness.\n","tags":["Level-0"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":16,"deletions":10}}}]},{"date":"2026-01-31T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"42203925e52eca23dc6ec1d6e5fc047954d2d71e","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 1: Add Echo and command messages","messageBody":"Sallybot.java: Repeat a string message that a user types in the CLI, sends the goodbye message when the command \"bye\" is entered.\n\nThe previous iteration of Sallybot only had hello and bye messages and lacked interaction with the user via user input.\n\nHere, we add a Scanner input that takes a string entered by the user, and prints that exact same string on the CLI. We add a while loop to constantly prompt the user to enter a message until the command \"bye\" is sent. We use a case statement to handle the commands entered by the user, and the case block handles the break from the while loop when \"bye\" is entered such that the program quits.\n\nTo provide users with the choice of constantly entering messages without needing to restart the application each time a message is entered, a while loop is used. We expect more commands to be introduced, so a case statement is utilised.\n\nIn addition, the content of the greeting and bye messages have been modified to better reflect the intended character of Sallybot, which follows the personality of its namesake.\n","tags":["Level-1"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":47,"deletions":11}}},{"hash":"c9e24e5ada030affe0b809d48b66b31686ef5dd5","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 2: Add Tasks and List","messageBody":"So far, Sallybot has only a few main features, greet the user, take in user input and exit when the command \"bye\" is entered.\n\nSallybot needs more features to be more useful and appealing to users. New features need to be introduced to achieve this.\n\nWe add the functionality to store text into a dynamic array that stores tasks instead of merely echoing them, so users can use Sallybot to store their lists of to-dos. We introduce the command \"list\" to list out all tasks stored in the array so far.\n\nDoing so adds the purpose of taking down tasks and to-dos to Sallybot, contributing to its utility.\n","tags":["Level-2"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":23,"deletions":10}}}]},{"date":"2026-02-01T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"9e0d9037fc26a9f19eeb1ba818162478d12778fe","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 3: Mark as Done","messageBody":"Add the ability to mark tasks as done and change the status back to not done.\n\nPreviously, the task list had no capability of marking and displaying a task as completed or not.\n\nWe add new class Task to create task objects that come with a description and a status that indicates the completion status of a task, as well as new commands \"mark [index of task]\" and \"unmark [index of task]\" to mark a task at a certain index as done or not done respectively.\n\nThis adds more customizability and immersion to the Tasks feature of Sallybot.\n\nMinor additions such as Javadoc comments have been added.\n","tags":["Level-3"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":112,"deletions":13}}}]},{"date":"2026-02-03T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"e65035940d8876a1ecbb98f273277fd97e62fdb4","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"A-CodingStandard: Comply with Coding Standards","messageBody":"Verify all the code in the files comply with the CS2113 coding standards.\n\nA few parts of the code were not compliant with the CS2113 coding standards.\n\nWe rectify the try-catch statement and rename a Boolean variable.\n\nNow, the code follows the coding standards.\n","tags":["A-CodingStandard"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":5,"deletions":7}}}]},{"date":"2026-02-05T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"01cdb6ddabd13c5e4b6cf7d811ba03e4d0684623","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Level 4: ToDos, Events, Deadlines","messageBody":"Add functionality for different types of tasks to Sallybot.\n\nAt this juncture, Sallybot is able to keep track of tasks, but not specialised ones such as deadlines which have a date/time specified. Sallybot does not also state the number of tasks remaining.\n\nHere, we create new ToDo, Deadline and Event subclasses that inherit from the Task class, each inheriting features from the parent class as well as having their own features such as Event having from and to String variables to take note of the starting and ending dates.\n\nDoing so adds better organisation of tasks and adds more functionality to the task tracking feature of Sallybot and thus adding more dynamism to Sallybot.\n\nIn addition, some UI improvements have been implemented.\n","tags":["Level-4"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":100,"deletions":32}}},{"hash":"966078f10aa71881d3fd467e0546ee6eb804372a","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"A-TextUiTesting: Automated Text UI Testing","messageBody":"Tested Sallybot using the I/O redirection technique.\n\nPreviously, there was no automated or semi-automated testing done on Sallybot, only manual testing.\n\nWe make slight modifications to the runtest.bat and runtest.sh files, put in some commands for testing in input.txt, and modify the file EXPECTED.TXT to include the expected output. After which, we run either 1 of the runtest files to obtain ACTUAL.TXT, which is then compared to EXPECTED.TXT using the automatic batch file.\n\nThis allows us to find any inconsistencies in the output that Sallybot gives as opposed to the ideal output with ease, and make the necessary rectifications.\n\nFrom the tests, it was determined that putting the Scanner definition in the while loop in Sallybot.java was unideal as it caused errors during the automated testing, so it was moved out of the loop.\n","tags":["A-TextUiTesting"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":7,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":3,"deletions":1},"bat":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"sh":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}}]},{"date":"2026-02-06T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"b76ba732d16a06a96b65687616d41809a1706336","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"A-CodeQuality: Improve Code Quality","messageBody":"Improve the code quality according to the recommendations given by CS2113 to Sallybot.\n\nPreviously, some of the code in Sallybot had poor readability, block organisation and needed refactoring.\n\nWe extract a few methods from the case statement in Sallybot.java, as well as tweak and add Javadoc comments and regular comments that were clear and met the standards.
