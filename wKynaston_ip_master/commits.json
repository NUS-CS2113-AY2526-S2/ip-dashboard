Used a if statement as there is only two conditions as of now","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-1"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":25,"deletions":2}}},{"hash":"594ab40d8dceb47b83eea2011faa6f331263d79a","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"-added 2 global variables, one is a String array which can take in and store inputs. Another is a int which tracks which position needs to be filled next. -Changed the if else statement in the boolean repeat function into a switch case statemen, kept the parameters for to.Lower. Put in a bye case which outputs a goodbye speech and for the list case implemented a for loop that iterates throuhg the catalogue and prints out the values stored inside each index. If the next value is NULL means the end of the array has been reached and the loop will exit and return back to the main function -added a default case which does not hit either of the specific case scenarios above and this defualt case just adds the input into the catalogue into the fill position and updates the fill position","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-2"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":19,"deletions":4}}},{"hash":"b4bb6a11b52c882d08206429c5fed5686bd6ba7e","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"-within the while loop in main after takin the users input, the input is broken down into two parts using .split(\"\\\\s+\"), byu doing so we are not only able to take into account one spacing, but even if we input mark     1 with multiple spacings in between we are still able to obtain mark as parts[0] amd 1 as part[1[] -then i go into a if else if statement whereby if the length of parts arrray is only 1 then i enter one if statement but if the length of parts array euqla 2 i enter the if statement where i converted parts[1] into an int -renanmed the repeat method to actionables and overloaded it so that if it takes in one string and one int it will only have the mark and unmark functions within that method","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-3"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":42,"deletions":18}}}]},{"date":"2026-01-30T00:00:00","commitResults":[{"hash":"052096f595d6e050c670f540bd5c8a9d90c0e750","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"-realised that the former if else if statement within the while loop in the main method had a flaw whereby if i input a string with a space it will enter the actionalbles function with 2 parameters instead of the actionables with one.
